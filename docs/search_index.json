COVID-19 soon became the most overwhelming topic in year 2020. Everyone’s life was severely impacted by the spread of COVID-19. In this project, our goal is to analyze different aspects of this pandemic: its start, its spread, and most importantly, its ending, which is the vaccination. In the following sections, we will discuss: How we collect our data How we process our data The results of our analysis We will mainly explore on the following questions: 1. What is trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths since the start of 2020? 2. How are the three major vaccines distributed across United States? 3. Which states, ethnicity, or age group are falling behind regarding vaccination? 4. How well does each state utilize the medical resources/services they have? Throughout the project we will try to use graph and analysis tp answer the questions above.

This is the data given by official CDC department. The reason we pick this data source rather than others is that CDC is the most authoritative agency regarding COVID vaccine distribution. There are 3 types of COVID vaccine currently available: Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen. We choose to compare how different vaccines are distributed in US. We thought of picking the most widely-used vaccine Pfizer and analyze its trend. However, we soon discovered that some states use Pfizer more often compared to Other states. Therefore, analyzing Pfizer vaccine alone doesn’t give any insight about vaccine usage across the country. Only cross-comparison of the three vaccines can give a complete image of how vaccines are used. Some basic information about the data sets are provided below: COVID-19_Vaccine_Distribution_Allocations_by_Jurisdiction_-_Moderna.csv: ## Rows: 1,071 ## Columns: 4 ## $ Jurisdiction &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Connecticut&quot;, &quot;Maine&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;New … ## $ Week_of_Allocations &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/… ## $ First_Dose_Allocations &lt;dbl&gt; 37400, 14300, 72100, 14300, 11300, 6700, 91300… ## $ Second_Dose_Allocations &lt;dbl&gt; 37400, 14300, 72100, 14300, 11300, 6700, 91300… COVID-19_Vaccine_Distribution_Allocations_by_Jurisdiction_-_Janssen.csv: ## Rows: 378 ## Columns: 3 ## $ Jurisdiction &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Connecticut&quot;, &quot;Maine&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;New H… ## $ Week_of_Allocations &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/1… ## $ First_Dose_Allocations &lt;dbl&gt; 6400, 2500, 12300, 2500, 2000, 1200, 15600, 198… COVID-19_Vaccine_Distribution_Allocations_by_Jurisdiction_-_Pfizer.csv: ## Rows: 1,134 ## Columns: 4 ## $ Jurisdiction &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Connecticut&quot;, &quot;Maine&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;New … ## $ Week_of_Allocations &lt;chr&gt; &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/12/2021&quot;, &quot;04/… ## $ First_Dose_Allocations &lt;dbl&gt; 51480, 19890, 97110, 19890, 15210, 9360, 12402… ## $ Second_Dose_Allocations &lt;dbl&gt; 51480, 19890, 97110, 19890, 15210, 9360, 12402… After checking the data set, we find that though the data sets have no missing values, there exist some inconsistency in the number of first and second dose allocations for a few states. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Data of CDC COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States 3.2 Data of CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Allocations by Jurisdiction", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Data of CDC COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States In the vaccination_us table we are only interested in the colums -(State/Territory/Federal Entity, Total Doses Delivered, People with at least One Dose by State of Residence, Percent of Total Pop with at least One Dose by State of Residence, People Fully Vaccinated by State of Residence, Percent of Total Pop Fully Vaccinated by State of Residence, Percent of Total Pop with 1+ Doses by State of Residence, Percent of Total Pop with 2 Doses by State of Residence), hence we need to subset our data. After plotting the missing values graph (please see the graph in Sec 4.1), we discovered that there are three states contains missing values. They are Bureau of Prisons, Dept of Defense and Veterans Health. theses three values are not any states so we decided to remove these three records. The second table is total cases and death by states since Jan 22nd 2020 in the case_death_clean_overtime table we are only interested in the colums -(submission_date, state, tot_cases, new_case, tot_death, new_death), hence we need to subset my data) hence we need to subset our data. Furthermore, submission date is in string format. we changed it to date type. Also, remove daily new case and daily new death where the number is negative. In order to see total death and cases by state we need to aggregate values by states. Download longitude and latidue values for each state then merge it to our data. 3.2 Data of CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Allocations by Jurisdiction For all 3 vaccines, we only use the count of first dose as the count for the vaccine distribution. The reasons are: All 1st dose vaccine takers will take the second dose in the future (except for very rare cases where a person have extreme side effects or other excuses for not taking the second dose). Janssen vaccine is a single-dose vaccine, so in order to be consistent, we only compare the first dose of each vaccine. In the original data, there are a few mismatch between the number of 1st dose and the second’s. But fortunately, none of these mismatch is from the main 50 U.S states, so we removed all the states with inconsistent numbers. Moreover, as data on the official CDC website updates daily. We pick April 7 to be the end-date in order to maintain consistency. In another word, we are analyzing vaccine distribution from its start week (varies for different vaccine) to the week of 04/05/2021 for 3 different vaccines. Therefore, we exclude rows with Week_of_Allocations == 4/12/2021 As we are also interested in the cumulative allocations since the time when data has been collected, we add one more cumulative value column to the data set. One Data Example - the Moderna vaccine allocations: ## # A tibble: 896 x 4 ## states week_date dose_allocations cum_dose_allocations ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Alabama 2020-12-21 84300 84300 ## 2 Alaska 2020-12-21 26800 26800 ## 3 Arizona 2020-12-21 119400 119400 ## 4 Arkansas 2020-12-21 51100 51100 ## 5 California 2020-12-21 672600 672600 ## 6 Chicago 2020-12-21 46800 46800 ## 7 Colorado 2020-12-21 95600 95600 ## 8 Connecticut 2020-12-21 63300 63300 ## 9 Delaware 2020-12-21 16700 16700 ## 10 District of Columbia 2020-12-21 12600 12600 ## # … with 886 more rows From the cumulative allocations column, we can know which states have the top vaccine distribution allocations for each type of vaccines. And very interestingly, we find that the states with top vaccine distribution allocations are the same for all 3 vaccines. Therefore, all considering that seeing a graph of a vaccine’s distribution in all states would be time-consuming and untidy, we highlight the top eight states out of all U.S. states/territories for later analyzing: ## Are states with top allocations identical? TRUE ## [1] &quot;California&quot; &quot;Texas&quot; &quot;Florida&quot; &quot;Ohio&quot; ## [5] &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; &quot;New York&quot; &quot;North Carolina&quot; &quot;Illinois&quot; "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Data of CDC COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States 4.2 Data of CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Allocations by Jurisdiction", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Data of CDC COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States Below is the plot mentioned in Sec 3.1 for the vaccination_us table: After plotting the missing values graph we discovered that there are three states contains missing values. They are Bureau of Prisons, Dept of Defense and Veterans Health. Theses three values are not any states so we decided to remove these three records For thecase_death_clean_overtime table, we plot the table by states to see if there is any missing value again. There is no missing values in this table (0 in the means there is no new case or new death for the date) 4.2 Data of CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Allocations by Jurisdiction Fortunately, the three data sets provided by CDC officials are all cleaned and don’t contain any missing values. For those jurisdictions that don’t give any vaccination at a certain period, the corresponding entry is default to 0. Therefore, we didn’t find any missing values regarding these tables. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 COVID-19 Spread 5.2 Data Analysis on Vaccinations 5.3 Level of Medical Resources/Services, accross states", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 COVID-19 Spread First things first, we want to get a general picture of COVID-19’s spread in US. Intuitively, the confirmed cases and death cases number of COVID-19 can reflect its spread most efficiently. So, to gain a direct view on these two data, we use heat map to plot out the number of cases confirmed and deaths by state on the US map. From the plots, we can see that some states a severely higher than others. Then, we plot out the number of cases and death over time to see how COVID-19 developed in the past year. 5.2 Data Analysis on Vaccinations After gaining the general picture of COVID-19’s impact in United States, we look into the data of newly developed vaccines. There are 3 types of COVID vaccine currently available: Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen. We choose to compare how different vaccines are distributed in US. We thought of picking the most widely-used vaccine Pfizer and analyze its trend. However, we soon discovered that some states use Pfizer more often compared to Other states. Therefore, analyzing Pfizer vaccine alone doesn’t give any insight about vaccine usage across the country. Only cross-comparison of the three vaccines can give a complete image of how vaccines are used. 5.2.1 3 Types of Vaccine Allocations Analysis First, Let’s look at the most well-known Pfizer Vaccine: Pfizer vaccine is the first vaccine that was put to use (President Joe Biden also used this vaccine). From the graph Pfizer Vaccine Allocations in the Top 8 States, we can see that the trends of distribution of Pfizer Vaccine appear similarly in the top 8 states. We see an increase of doses after the week 02/15/2021. This is because we see a significant increase of vaccine production at that period. The distribution of Pfizer has been increasing until last week, where we see a drop in doses. Also, the weekly allocations to each state stays quite steadily in terms of the ranking. e.g. California always gets the largest amount of Pfizer vaccine. From the Cumulative Number of Pfizer Vaccine Allocations, by State table, we can easily see that there are barely any crossing line between each state. So there may exist a fixed ratio for the Pfizer vaccine distribution to each state. Next is the Moderna Vaccine: Moderna vaccine was put to use a week after Pfizer Vaccine. We see that the pattern is similar across the top 8 states. The trend is also very steady, with an increase at the week 01/25/2021, and then maintain flat after 02/15/2021. There is still no crossing line between each state in the Culumulative graph, so the assumption of fixed ratio holds for Moderna, too. At last we look at Janssen Vaccine: Janssen Vaccine by Johnson&amp;Johnson was put to use late February 2021. We see a huge increase of Janssen vaccine after it was put to use. The advantage of this vaccine compared to the others is: Janssen vaccine is easy to store (at refrigerator temperature), and it only requires a single shot. Therefore, it is getting more and more welcomed in U.S. Despite its low overall-efficacy, Janssen is found to be protective against new COVID variants. This is another reason why it’s popular. And agian, there is no crossing line in the Culumulative graph. The assumption of fixed distribution ratio for each state holds for all three vaccines. We then plot the total distributions of the three vaccines across the country: We see that the distributions of the two traditional vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) have been steadily growing, and the new vaccine Janssen has become more and more popular in the past month. By the end of last week, we can see that the three vaccines are somewhat equally popular across the country. Above is a plot showing the overall cumulative amounts of each vaccine that has been distributed since their release. We find that total amount of Pfizer has caught up Moderna and ranked first among the three vaccines in the past month. And even though that Janssen has become more and more popular, there is still a very large gap between it and the other two vaccines, in the perspective of total amount. 5.2.2 Correlation Between Vaccination Rate and Different Groups In the previous section, we analyzed the distribution of vaccine across the U.S states. Now we want to dig deeper into the data and find out how different groups (states, ethnicity or age) are doing. What is the vaccination rate of each state? We want to see which states are falling behind, so that we need to make more effort for the states that are less than 30% of vaccination rate from the graph Who we should target to get vaccinated by age group? From the graph below we found that not a lot people from the age 0-49 are vaccinated. We should target them in the future. Who we should target to get vaccinated by ethnicity? From the graph below, we can see that most of the ethnicity group stay in the same stage of getting vaccination, except the Multiple/Other group. Besides, American Indian/Alaska Native and White are doing slightly better than other groups. Yet, we would put a question mark on Multiple/Other group’s outstanding percentage of vaccination rate, as we think this may be due to their small base (less total number of people) and the difficulty of collecting data from non-specified group of people. 5.3 Level of Medical Resources/Services, accross states Just as the plots for the 3 different vaccine’s cumulative allocations of each state. Now, we can easily derive the cumulative allocations of the 3 different vaccines in total, across past few months. From the plot below, we can see that California, Texas, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina and Illinois receive the largest amount of vaccine allocations. So we may consider these 8 states to be the top states in terms of medical resources distribution. This allocation preference echoes with the heat map graphs of Cases Confirmed and Deaths by states we plotted above in Sec 5.1. We can see that the colors of the top 8 states’ corresponding area in the map are brighter than the rest part. For instance, California and Texas, which rank first and second place in the vaccine distribution allocations, have brightest color in the map graphs too. Thus, we may conclude that U.S. distributed the vaccines according to the severity of the pandemic in each state. However, this result may also be derived from uncertain base units e.g. the different population in each state. Therefore, we choose to look back to the vaccination_us table and check the Doses Delivered per 100K people. With the same unit of 100K people, we find that: We get this very interesting result that none of our previous “Top Resources State” gets into the top ten states of this resources per 100K people plot. After analyzing the amount of resources each state get, we are also interested in how well they are utilizing these vaccines. So, we plot out a rate contrast figure of the dose administrated(green) vs. delivered(grey) per 100K people. The plot shows that the level of vaccine utilization has almost no relationship to the amount of total resources that one state gets. And again, none of the top 8 allocation states appears in the top 10 ranking. The best one, New York State, only gets the 14th place. The state with great amount of vaccine distribution should reflect themselves on how to utilize the medical resources more efficiently.

You can click buttons to choose to see the comparison across different ethnicity groups and age groups. We learned that Hispanic/Latino and Black ethnicity group and the age between 0-49 (especially children age &lt;18) are falling behind. Fully Vaccinated percent by ethnicity Fully Vaccinated percent by age group "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Let’s see to what extent our initial questions are answered: Since the start of 2020, COVID new cases had been growing steadily, and reached its peak at the end of 2020 and start of 2021. After vaccination was approved by the government and put to use at the end of 2020, we see a sharp decrease of COVID-19 new cases and deaths. There are three vaccines approved by US FDA: Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen. For all three vaccines, the distribution patterns don’t vary in different states. All three vaccines see an increase of usage after their releases. This is because we still have uptrending vaccine demands across the country. By putting three vaccines on the same graph, we see that Janssen vaccine had the highest increase rate (that is dosage increase amount / time period length). Currently, the three vaccines enjoy almost the same popularity. As demand for vaccine continue to increase in April due to the nation-wide vaccination on everyone, we expect Janssen vaccine to become the most popular vaccine across the country. When going deep into how the vaccines were distributed across the population, we discover that old people (above 50 years old) were getting the most proportion of the vaccines. This is understandable because they are more vulnerable to the virus. Additionally, we find that each the ethnicity group are basically on the same page of getting vaccination, with Multiple/Other and American Indian/Alaska Native doing slightly better. We expect the vaccines to become more evenly distribution across age group and ethnicity group after April when vaccines become available to everyone. By examining individual states, we see that there is a positive relationship between total cases in a state and number of vaccines distributed to the state. This makes sense because CDC is expected to give more vaccines to states with more cases. However, we found that the efficiency of vaccine use (that is, doses given / doses received from CDC) is not related to the total cases in the state. Throughout the project, we hope we have shown a clear image of the development of the COVID-19, and how we are doing to stop the pandemic. At the end, we want to mention that since the limit of time and people, this project inevitably fails to cover all aspects of this pandemic. We try our best to make those aspects that are discussed more clear and comprehensive.
