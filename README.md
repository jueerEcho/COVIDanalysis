### About the project:

At the end of 2019, the first COVID-19 case was discovered. COVID-19 soon became the most overwhelming topic in year 2020. Everyone's life was severely impacted by the spread of COVID-19. In this project, our goal is to analyze different aspects of this pandemic: its start, its spread, and most importantly, its ending, which is the vaccination.
